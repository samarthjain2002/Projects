# Unit Converter

This Python-based unit converter allows users to convert measurements between different units for height, mass, temperature, and currency exchange.

## Features
- Convert **Height** between centimeters, meters, feet, and feet-inches.
- Convert **Mass** between grams, kilograms, and pounds.
- Convert **Temperature** between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Convert **Currency** using real-time exchange rates from an external API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `python-dotenv` library
- A valid API key for exchange rates from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
